##Project 1: Real-Time Filtering

Real-time filtering project involves multiple challenging tasks related to filtering images/frames from live video. This projectâ€™s goal is to get users acquainted with C/C++, the OpenCV package, and the operations of reading, extracting, processing, and writing images and applying different filters on the frame in real-time.

For each task different key presses were assigned. The above processing tasks are performed using OpenCV libraries in C++ programming language in Xcode IDE (Version 14.2) on MacBook Pro (M1 Chip).

Files:<br />
imgDisplay.cpp -> Displaying, Quitting and resizing the frame.<br />
vidDisplay.cpp -> The main function executing different filter functions.<br />
filters.cpp -> Consists all image manipulation functions.<br />
filters.hpp -> header file
